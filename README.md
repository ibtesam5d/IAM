# Designing and Implementing Tailored IAM Solutions to Enterprise Network
This project implements Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions to enhance organization's cybersecurity. Before implementing IAM solutions, a thorough assessment of IAM readiness was performed in multiple criteria. The goal is to provide customized solution that is effective and scalable while aligning business processes and objectives. Finally a detailed step-by-step IAM implementation plan was created including timelines of the project, key milestones achieved at each stages of the implementation and resources required to perform the tasks. This project is part of Cybersecurity Job simulation at TATA group provided through The Forage Virtual Internship.
